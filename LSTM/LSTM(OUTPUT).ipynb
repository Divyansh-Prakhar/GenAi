        "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special type of Recurrent Neural Network designed to overcome the limitations of vanilla RNNs. LSTM uses memory cells and gating mechanisms (input, forget, and output gates) to selectively store and update information over long sequences. In text generation, an LSTM learns long-term dependencies between characters or words and predicts the next token based on both recent and distant context, resulting in more coherent and less repetitive text compared to basic RNNs.\n"
