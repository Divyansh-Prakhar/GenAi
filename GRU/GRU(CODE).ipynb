        "Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network designed to improve upon vanilla RNNs while being simpler than LSTM. GRU uses update and reset gates to control the flow of information and maintain long-term dependencies in sequences. In text generation, a GRU learns patterns from sequential text data and predicts the next character or word using both current input and past context, producing more coherent text than basic RNNs with lower computational complexity than LSTM.\n"
