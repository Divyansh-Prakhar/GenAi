        "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a sequence-based neural network designed to process sequential data such as text. Unlike N-gram models, RNNs maintain a hidden state that carries information from previous time steps, allowing the model to capture context across an entire sequence. In text generation, an RNN learns patterns in text data and predicts the next character or word based on both the current input and past context, resulting in more coherent text generation.\n"
