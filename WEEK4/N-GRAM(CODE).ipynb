        "\n",
        "An N-gram language model is a statistical approach used in Natural Language Processing to predict the next word or character in a sequence based on the previous *(n−1)* tokens. It learns patterns by counting the frequency of token sequences in a given text corpus. N-gram models are simple, interpretable, and commonly used as baseline models for text generation, but they are limited by their fixed context size.\n"
